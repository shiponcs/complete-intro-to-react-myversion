# complete-intro-to-react-myversion

It's a code repository that I created with conitnuing the course Complete to React V5 in frontendmasters.
Course code respository can be found here: https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5

### Difference:

In his course, Brian Holt used TSLint, but by the time, TSLint got deprecated so I needed to configure ESLint to work with Typescript, as of working in this branch at this commit, it was really painful and burdensome for me to achieve everything because it had not been so long that TSLint got deprecated and that's why guideline for ESLint for Typescript was not so friendly to achieve and [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) was not that much great that time either.
